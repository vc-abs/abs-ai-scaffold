# Tool Policy Configuration
# Referenced at runtime by prompts and agents. Update here to affect all referencing prompts.

tools:
  preferred_shell: bash
  git: terminal
  file_operations: shell
  ci_operations: shell

auto_execution:
  default: disallowed
  exception: "Explicit user invocation (e.g., `/commit` prompt when user types `/commit`)"
  rules:
    - no_auto_commit: true
    - no_auto_push: true
    - safe_operations_allowed: "Analysis, dry-run, and informational operations may auto-execute"

shell_commands:
  git_status: "git status"
  git_diff: "git diff"
  git_add: "git add ."
  git_commit: 'git commit -m "<message>"'

avoid:
  - GUI git tools (GitKraken, SourceTree) for automated workflows
  - Interactive UI dialogs that block automation

rationale: "Terminal commands ensure consistent behavior across machines and avoid interactive UI dialogs that block automation."
