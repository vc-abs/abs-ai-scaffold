# ABS AI Scaffold

	A scaffold to help with kick-starting AIFSD projects or to convert existing projects into one.

## Approach

	This project / repo is meant to provide the scaffolding for AIFSD. New projects could use this to setup their base repos by prompting. With existing projects, the idea is to merging this repo without overriding.

## Supported Tools

This scaffold is **optimized for GitHub Copilot** integration. Prompts, agents, and workflows are designed specifically for Copilot's capabilities and context model.

- **Supported:** GitHub Copilot (Chat, CLI, Editor integration)
- **Not supported:** Cursor, OpenAI configuration

*Focus: Copilot-first development to avoid scope creep and maintain consistent tooling.*
